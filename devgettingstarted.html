Getting Started with Skuid
==========================

## Your First Skuid Pages
The following tutorials will get you up and running with Skuid in minutes. We'll start by installing Skuid, then walk step-by-step through creating pages to use in place of the Account Tab and Account Detail page actions. Then we'll actually implement these pages as overrides for those Account actions.

##Using Skuid in your AppExchange Apps (Managed Packages)
As a Force.com ISV (a developer of custom applications for Salesforce.com users), you can actually include Skuid, and your custom Skuid interfaces, right inside of your package! To do this, you'll need to [create a Skuid module](http://plusplusben.github.com/skuid/devcreatemodule.html).

##Extending Skuid / Creating custom components
Although we will be continue to add additional core Skuid components over time, we've made it easy for *you* to create your own Skuid components. To get started, check out our guide to [creating custom Skuid components](http://plusplusben.github.com/skuid/devcreatecomponent.html), as well as the sample [custom map component](http://plusplusben.github.com/skuid/devcreatecomponent.html) on our Github repo.
